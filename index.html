        <br>
        This summer, I had the opportunity to work as a data analyst for the New York Life Direct,
        Customer Insights team. Here, I gained experience performing

        <span><strong>
            <font color=#293462>
              large-scale data manipulation, data mining,
              and data interpretation to identify actionalable insights</font>
          </strong></span>

        for multiple cross-functional groups within the Insurance Operations sector.
        <br>
        <br>
        During my 10-week internship, I led two initiatives,
        a <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-journey-map">Customer Journey Map</a> creation and an overhaul
        of the customer retention process. The latter of which, projects to increase monthly annualized premiums
        retained by 25%, amounting in nearly $200k saved per month moving forward.

        During my sophomore year, I mentored a cohort of high school students of various backgrounds,
        assisting them with college application readiness, college-specific essay writing, and interview
        preparation.
        <br>
        <br>
        I conducted an average of 12 video meetings each week across all 6 clients, resulting in 50% of
        the cohort receiving an offer from one of their top choices, or being selected for a competitive,
        merit-based scholarship.

        Last summer, I helped a startup esports team, Team Genji, into now

        <br>
        <br>
        While the players travelled to win points for the team, I reached out to hundreds of marketing heads, facilitated
        numerous meetings with brands, and drafted several partnership contracts in hopes of securing sponsorship
        deals from national mega-corporations. After three months,

        <span><strong>

              I secured deals with multiples companies, including Soylent

          On campus, I facilitate and organize workshops, off-campus events, and entrepreneurship conferences/competitions

          In addition to my school-specific involvement, I have also worked to create and grow a local dance competition, called Jumpstart Expo in my hometown
